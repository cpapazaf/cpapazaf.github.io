## Challenge
Connect the cheap sq11 micro cameras to rpi! [SQ11][sq11-ebay]

## Prerequisites
* RPI3 running Raspbian GNU/Linux 9 (stretch)
* One or more sq11 micro cameras
* fswebcam

## Description

When connecting the sq11 to rpi through usb, for the first time, you may notice the `dmesg` output as shown below.

```bash
[ 1465.185248] usb 1-1-port2: over-current change
[ 1465.441253] usb 1-1-port2: over-current change
[ 1465.697251] usb 1-1-port2: over-current change
...
```

There are multiple reasons why we get `usb 1-1-port2: over-current change`.
1. You are not providing enough energy to rpi (["max_usb_current=1"](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/43609/what-could-be-causing-over-current-change-all-the-sudden) might be a case)! I would suggest you use at least a 5V-2A plug.
2. The camera is not open yet :) Hold the power button and check the `dmesg`. (It doesn't  matter if a micro sd is inserted to the camera or not)

The output will look like:

```bash
[ 1468.548203] usb 1-1.4: new high-speed USB device number 8 using dwc_otg
[ 1468.678775] usb 1-1.4: config 1 interface 3 has no altsetting 1

[ 1469.750660] sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Attached SCSI removable disk
```

Notice that the camera is now found as a `UVC` device and is attached to the `/dev/video0` file.

`lsusb` output is like:

```bash
Bus 001 Device 008: ID 1908:3272 GEMBIRD
Bus 001 Device 003: ID 0424:ec00 Standard Microsystems Corp. SMSC9512/9514 Fast Ethernet Adapter
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 0424:9514 Standard Microsystems Corp. SMC9514 Hub
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
```

and the video list looks like:

```bash
pi@monitor:~ $ v4l2-ctl --list-devices
GENERAL - AUDIO: GENERAL - UVC  (usb-3f980000.usb-1.4):
        /dev/video0
```

Next step is to take a picture by using `fswebcam`

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y fswebcam
```

and ...

```bash
fswebcam  -i 0 -d v4l2:/dev/video0  --no-banner  --jpeg 95  --save test1.jpg
--- Opening v4l2:/dev/video0...
/dev/video0 opened.
Adjusting resolution from 384x288 to 320x240.
--- Capturing frame...
GD Error: gd-jpeg: JPEG library reports unrecoverable error: Not a JPEG file: starts with 0x31 0xcdCaptured frame in 0.00 seconds.
--- Processing captured image...
Disabling banner.
Setting output format to JPEG, quality 95
Writing JPEG image to 'test1.jpg'.
```

The `GD Error` shown above is a topic ["here"](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=60076) and the solution is to include ` -S 2`. This way, fswebcam will skip 2 frames and the outut will look like:

```bash
--- Opening v4l2:/dev/video0...
/dev/video0 opened.
Adjusting resolution from 384x288 to 320x240.
--- Capturing frame...

```

Enjoy!
